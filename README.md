#  Game Analytics Project: Global Video Game Sales Analysis

Sales performance and critical acclaim in video games are related, but not always aligned. While top-selling games often score well on Metacritic, several highly rated games underperform commercially — pointing to the importance of marketing, platform reach, and genre appeal.

Supporting Points:
- Descriptive analysis shows Action and Sports genres dominate global sales, while RPG and Adventure genres often receive higher Metacritic scores.
- Diagnostic analytics reveal a weak correlation (r ≈ 0.3) between critic score and global sales, especially outside of North America.
- Regression modeling using Metacritic data improves sales prediction accuracy over VGChartz-only models.
- Time series trends highlight a steep drop in sales post-2010, with potential digital transition effects.

## Can we predict a video game’s commercial success based on platform, genre, and critical/user reviews? What insights do historical trends provide about future performance?
