## 📈 Key Steps Taken

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed null values, duplicates
   - Fixed incorrect data types (e.g., date columns)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

4. **Model Building (if applicable):**
   - Used Logistic Regression and Random Forest
   - Achieved 82% accuracy and 78% precision

5. **Visualization:**
   - Used Tableau to create interactive dashboards on churn trends
